<p id="a"><b>Q1-My booking has been rejected, but my credit card has been charged. What do I do?<br></p></b>
<p id="b">A1-This is a very rare situation, and can occur in case of a network fluctuation at the time of confirming the transaction. In this case, a reverse
request for the charge on your credit card will be sent by www.goformovie.com to ICICI Bank on the same day. Please be assured that 
if the ticket has not been successfully booked, your card payment will be reversed.<br></p>
<p id="a"><b>Q2-Can I cancel bookings on GoForMovie?<br></p></b>
<p id="b">A2-This is subject to GoForMovie terms and conditions, tickets once bought online are considered sold and cannot be cancelled, refunded
or exchanged.<br></p>
<p id="a"><b>Q3-I have a supplementary/ add-on card. Can I avail of the privileges too?<br></p></b>
<p id="b">A3-Yes, as a supplementary/ add-on card member, the privileges are also available to you.<br></p>
<p id="a"><b>Q4-I applied for the offer but my transaction did not get through. Now I am unable to avail the offer.<br></p></b>
<p id="b">A3-In case you get an error message 'Transaction failed' kindly wait for 20 minutes before trying to avail of the offer again. However, if you get
an error message 'Stock for the day is exhausted', then it is likely that the stocks have been depleted.</p><br>
